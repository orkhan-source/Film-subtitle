<i>Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

3
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:23,664
<i>And others,</i>

4
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:26,914
<i>I can almost see it.</i>

5
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:29,497
<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,955
<i>like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise</i>

7
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,580
<i>and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.</i>

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,289
<i>Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.</i>

9
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,039
<i>Wish I'd watched more closely</i>

10
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,164
<i>and understood.</i>

11
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:51,622
<i>But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning</i>

12
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:54,830
<i>until you come out
the other side.</i>

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,664
Come on!

14
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,789
Come on!

15
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,455
Come on!

16
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:49,080
I'm gonna miss out.

17
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,164
I've seen this contest

18
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:57,789
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

19
00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:59,580
I can do it.

20
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:02,664
Just do your best.

21
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,080
And remember,

22
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,080
greatness is not
what you think.

23
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:09,122
Pace yourself and watch.

24
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,664
No!

25
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:30,330
No!

26
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,789
That's not fair!

27
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,664
No.

28
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,539
No. But...

29
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,830
- You took the short path.
- But...

30
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:39,455
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

31
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,497
But that...

32
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,955
That is the truth.

33
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,497
That is the only truth,

34
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,664
and truth is all there is.

35
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,122
But I would've won,
if you didn't...

36
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,164
But you didn't.

37
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:54,414
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

38
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,455
and there is no shame in that.

39
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,205
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart

40
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,539
and not accepting it.

41
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:07,164
No true hero is born from lies.

42
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,872
Your time will come, Diana.

43
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,705
When?

44
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,289
When you're ready.

45
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,830
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.

46
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,539
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

47
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:32,414
She did it through
true acts of bravery.

48
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,789
Like patience, diligence,

49
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:39,122
and the courage
to face the truth.

50
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:49,039
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,

51
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:52,830
and everything
will be different.

52
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:58,205
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

53
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,205
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

54
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,414
<i>Life is good,
but it can be better.</i>

55
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,080
<i>And why shouldn't it be?</i>

56
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,747
<i>Everything we've
ever dreamed about</i>

57
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,747
<i>is right at our fingertips.</i>

58
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,497
<i>But are you
reaping the rewards?</i>

59
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,664
<i>Do you...</i>

60
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,205
<i>...have it all?</i>

61
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:44,539
Slow down, dude.

62
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:45,664
No way.

63
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,247
Dude!

64
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,330
<i>Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.</i>

65
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,205
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
- <i>The first oil company</i>

66
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,539
<i>run for the people,
by the people.</i>

67
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,039
<i>Think about finally having</i>

68
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,247
<i>everything you've
always wished for.</i>

69
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,414
Let's go!

70
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,997
Hey!

71
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:17,330
<i>For a low monthly fee,</i>

72
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,080
<i>you can own a piece</i>

73
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,122
<i>of the most lucrative industry
in the world.</i>

74
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,497
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

75
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,455
- <i>you strike gold.</i>
- Oh!

76
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,164
<i>No matter who you
are, no matter what you do,</i>

77
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:41,080
<i>you deserve to have it all.</i>

78
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:44,539
<i>Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?</i>

79
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:47,997
<i>Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?</i>

80
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,414
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
- <i>Join me today.</i>

81
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:52,455
- Yes!
- <i>Operators are standing by.</i>

82
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,705
<i>You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.</i>

83
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,872
<i>You don't even have
to work hard for it.</i>

84
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,872
Good morning.

85
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,664
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

86
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:05,789
<i>At Black Gold
Cooperative, all you need</i>

87
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,539
<i>is to want it!</i>

88
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,372
We get what we want,
and we go.

89
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,914
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

90
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,872
Word is on the street

91
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,372
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

92
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,414
If you don't tell,
we won't tell.

93
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:28,747
Yes, yes, yes!

94
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:34,330
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,955
Yes, yes, yes!

96
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,205
Sir, are you all right?

97
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,080
Gun!

98
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:57,747
He's got a gun!

99
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,997
Shut up! Please!

100
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,580
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

101
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,414
Stop! Mall Security!

102
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,164
No, no, you, you, right there!

103
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,247
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

104
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,539
Move, move, move!

105
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:10,747
Chief, they're running up
the escalator.

106
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,122
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

107
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:14,747
Freeze!

108
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,205
No!

109
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,664
We have several
armed assailants running free.

110
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,747
We need the police here,
right now.

111
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,247
Freeze!

112
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,289
Freeze!

113
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:31,164
Freeze! Freeze!

114
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,372
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

115
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,914
No. Dude, dude, calm...

116
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:36,664
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

117
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:37,997
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,455
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,747
What are you doing?

120
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,164
Hey, what are you doing?

121
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,914
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!

122
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,455
Just chill out.
Just chill.

123
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,705
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

124
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,497
No, no, no!

125
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,414
Put the kid back.

126
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,914
Listen to me.

127
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,289
Listen to me!

128
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:58,622
- No!
- What are you doing?

129
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,122
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

130
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,455
I'm not going back!

131
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,664
No!

132
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:04,830
Gonna let her go!

133
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,414
- No, no, no!
- No, no!

134
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,580
What? Who? What?

135
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,080
We won't be doing that today.

136
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:46,539
Whoa.

137
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,039
We... We... We should go...

138
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,705
Oh, my gosh!

139
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,539
Hold tight.

140
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:13,872
I hate guns.

141
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,622
We've got to go now. Come on.

142
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,330
Yo.

143
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:49,580
I'm sorry, lady.

144
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:51,414
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

145
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,539
It was his idea.

146
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:05,122
<i>And the
authorities still have questions.</i>

147
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,789
<i>In fact, the first is
a real doozy, which is,</i>

148
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:10,705
<i>who exactly
even stopped this crime?</i>

149
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,289
If the story around here
is to be believed,

150
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,247
it wasn't the police,

151
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,289
but a mysterious female savior

152
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,955
that multiple witnesses saw.

153
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,914
<i>If this sounds familiar,
it should.</i>

154
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:26,372
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

155
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:29,914
<i>across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.</i>

156
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,955
<i>Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,</i>

157
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,122
<i>who is this woman</i>

158
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,580
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

159
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,872
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

160
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:59,164
No. Just me.

161
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,705
Taxi!

162
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,414
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

163
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:30,080
Hey, we could share,
if you like?

164
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:32,539
No, thanks. I'll wait.

165
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,289
Oh, my.

166
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,455
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.

167
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,164
Jake, hi. Can you...

168
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:33,289
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

169
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,122
Good morning.

170
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,372
Hi. Thank you.

171
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:44,122
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.

172
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,830
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,

173
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,455
and part-time cryptozoologist.

174
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,330
Oh, wow.

175
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,539
I kept busy in college.

176
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,205
Sorry. It's these heels,
you know. It's stupid.

177
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,580
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

178
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:02,247
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

179
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,372
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

180
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,539
I like those.

181
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:06,914
Animal print.

182
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:09,497
Do you want to get lunch?

183
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,039
I, uh...

184
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:12,580
Not now, obviously.

185
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,372
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

186
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:17,497
Like, around...
Like, at lunchtime?

187
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,247
I have a lot of work today.

188
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,580
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

189
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:24,330
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

190
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:28,330
Ah! Diana, do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?

191
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,122
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

192
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,330
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

193
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:35,705
- Started last week.
- Oh!

194
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,080
Gemologist?

195
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,747
Yes. And zoologist.

196
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,830
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

197
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:44,330
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

198
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:45,705
The FBI?

199
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,622
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

200
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,205
The mall heist yesterday,

201
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,372
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

202
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:53,164
Front for what?

203
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:56,080
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.

204
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:58,330
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

205
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:01,205
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

206
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,039
with whatever they need.

207
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,247
Is that a yes?

208
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,580
Yes. I would, um...

209
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,664
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

210
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:09,872
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,580
We've met.

212
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,580
Have a nice day.

213
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:15,955
Bye, Diana.

214
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:22,247
Okay, item number 23.

215
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,164
Shoot. That's not it.

216
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,122
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

217
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:36,122
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Senora de Atocha.</i>

218
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,914
Wow.

219
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:41,414
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.

220
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,372
Oh, it's okay.

221
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:45,414
Here it is.

222
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,914
- What is it?
- Um...

223
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:50,289
Uh...

224
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,997
I can't tell.

225
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,247
Some light.

226
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,330
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

227
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:06,414
Um...

228
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,872
It's... It's citrine.

229
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,747
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

230
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,622
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

231
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:17,914
What do you think?

232
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,580
Fakes aren't my forte,
but let me see.

233
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:22,455
Mmm.

234
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:23,830
Latin.

235
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:25,622
At least
it's an antique, right?

236
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,622
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

237
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:30,955
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

238
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,455
"Place upon the object held

239
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,247
but one great wish."

240
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,622
You read Latin?

241
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:40,664
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.

242
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:42,664
So maybe it's, like,
a lucky charm or something?

243
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,039
Yeah, I guess.

244
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,372
Strange.

245
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:47,372
I really wish I had a coffee.

246
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,164
You're funny.

247
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:51,705
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

248
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,372
What?
Yeah, I'll take one.

249
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,122
Ooh, hot!

250
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:57,247
Hot, hot!

251
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,747
Did you see that?

252
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,372
Oh...

253
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,205
Can you imagine?

254
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,497
- If only.
- Hmm.

255
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:12,997
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

256
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,580
I do.

257
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:25,289
Well, um, anyway,
sorry to bother you.

258
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:27,872
If you need anything,
I'm around.

259
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,414
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

260
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:31,122
But thank you for...

261
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,122
That's okay. It's my job.

262
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,164
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

263
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:36,205
Okay.

264
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,997
Well, thanks for...

265
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,664
talking to me.

266
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,748
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

267
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:46,498
I mean, I'm fine.

268
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,706
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

269
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,831
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

270
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:54,915
Really?

271
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,540
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

272
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,831
Who are they kidding, right?

273
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,290
- So lame.
- Dorky.

274
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,706
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

275
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,290
That's, like,
the lamest of lames.

276
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,956
Wow. You're so funny.

277
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,165
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

278
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,998
I mean, no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.

279
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:44,373
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

280
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:46,123
You don't get out much?

281
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:47,373
No, not really.

282
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:49,040
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

283
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:51,456
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

284
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,956
who's, like, always out.

285
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,998
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

286
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:57,290
and you live out.
You're just out.

287
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,873
Like, you never get in.

288
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,665
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

289
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:04,790
And I would know because
I've never been popular.

290
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:05,956
You haven't?

291
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,456
You're so personable.

292
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,581
So... free.

293
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:14,165
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

294
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:15,456
What?

295
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,290
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

296
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:20,373
Oh, my gosh.

297
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,581
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

298
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,498
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.

299
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:27,623
I'm like, "Guys,
I can hear you."

300
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:33,915
Barbara, my life

301
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:37,290
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

302
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,665
We all have our struggles.

303
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:41,748
Yeah, we do.

304
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:45,540
Have you ever been in love?

305
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:50,040
Uh... Yeah.

306
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,706
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

307
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,873
You?

308
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:56,165
So many times, yeah.
All the time.

309
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,873
Often.

310
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,165
So what happened?

311
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,331
Where'd he go, your guy?

312
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:03,040
He, uh...

313
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,665
He died.

314
00:27:05,748 --> 00:27:11,373
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.

315
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:12,540
He was a pilot.

316
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:15,748
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

317
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:19,373
but he was great. It was true.

318
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:23,040
I get it.

319
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:25,373
Well, cheers to us.

320
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:28,706
Wishing us better luck,
I guess.

321
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,248
Hey, Leon.

322
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:38,873
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

323
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,456
Yeah. Going back to work.

324
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,623
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

325
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:45,540
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

326
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,040
Stay warm.

327
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,248
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

328
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,706
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

329
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:03,248
'Cause, uh,

330
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,206
you know, you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble

331
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,498
walking in those heels, huh?

332
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:08,873
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.

333
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,706
Hey, come on.
Let me walk you home.

334
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,331
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

335
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:15,790
Huh? Come on.

336
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:19,748
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

337
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,331
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

338
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:22,915
Let go of me!

339
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,331
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

340
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,873
Let go!

341
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,790
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

342
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,623
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

343
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,956
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

344
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,373
Honestly, it takes
no power at all.

345
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:51,706
Are you okay?

346
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,290
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

347
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:55,831
- Thank you.
- Of course.

348
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,081
Go home, okay?

349
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:59,040
- Yeah.
- Good night.

350
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:40,540
I do know what I'd wish for.

351
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:45,623
To be like Diana.

352
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:50,498
Strong, sexy,

353
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,540
cool.

354
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:57,790
Special.

355
00:30:58,498 --> 00:30:59,456
Oh...

356
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,040
Oh, no! Oh!

357
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,415
Sorry.

358
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:35,790
Oh, it's okay.

359
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:37,373
Barbara, thank God
you're good in heels.

360
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,040
Oh.

361
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:42,623
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

362
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:44,623
Wow. Looking good.

363
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,790
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

364
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:49,915
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.

365
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:51,873
Oh, Barbara!

366
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:53,040
Hi.

367
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,290
Perfect.

368
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:56,915
I have someone
I would like you to meet.

369
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,498
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

370
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:02,373
Uh,
it's "Doctor," actually.

371
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,665
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

372
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:07,373
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

373
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:10,581
Life is good,
but it can be better.

374
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:13,248
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

375
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,956
Oh, my gosh.
You're the oil guy.

376
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,456
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

377
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,706
Mr. Lord is considering

378
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,248
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.

379
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:25,165
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

380
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,373
of private tours
of our facilities,

381
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:28,956
and he asked for you by name.

382
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,665
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

383
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,498
Your reputation precedes you.

384
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:37,456
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.

385
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,331
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

386
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:41,956
Uh...

387
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,623
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

388
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:46,581
and we'll go.

389
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:10,831
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

390
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:15,998
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

391
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,748
I love that ruby.

392
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:24,081
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

393
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:25,748
- What?
- That's very...

394
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:30,040
Hey, have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?

395
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:31,415
- I'm right here.
- You are.

396
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:33,123
Thank God.

397
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,540
Oh, wait. You've got
a little dust on you.

398
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,915
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.

399
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:36,915
Oh, hi.

400
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:38,373
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

401
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,915
This is the one and only,

402
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,040
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

403
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:45,831
It's him.

404
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,415
Life is good,

405
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:50,915
but it can be better.

406
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,415
He's from TV.

407
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:55,748
Oh, I don't have a TV.

408
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:57,415
Well, I have a great
relationship with Sears.

409
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,748
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

410
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,498
Nineteen inches.

411
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,956
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

412
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,581
But thank you.

413
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:06,623
Okay.

414
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:09,373
You're so generous. Um...

415
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,165
Headline... Uh...

416
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,331
Mr. Lord

417
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:15,790
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian

418
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,623
while considering partnership,

419
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:20,165
and guess
what he decided to do?

420
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,165
Give his entire donation

421
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,331
to our department.

422
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:26,498
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

423
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,998
It's going to be
an amazing party.

424
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:30,373
I hope you have
something nice to wear.

425
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,498
I actually tend
to skip these events.

426
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:36,456
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy

427
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,456
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

428
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,040
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

429
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,290
I agree.

430
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:43,373
Except,

431
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,290
I like to party.

432
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:50,123
Oh, my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.

433
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:51,415
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

434
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,040
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.

435
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:54,581
No, I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...

436
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:56,331
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

437
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:57,373
...the shape that you're in.

438
00:34:57,456 --> 00:34:58,873
Great, so,

439
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:01,206
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.

440
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,873
You know,
I really should be going.

441
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:04,123
Thank you for the tour.

442
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:07,498
I will have to see you tonight.

443
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:09,748
See you tonight.

444
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:12,623
Bye. Have a good day.

445
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:14,873
I'll find you.

446
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,540
What?

447
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,665
I like him.

448
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:33,081
Thank you, John.

449
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:39,748
Ladies.

450
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,790
Mr. Lord.

451
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,873
Mr. Lord.

452
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,706
Not now, Raquel.
My supplements?

453
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,665
On your desk,
but Mr. Lord.

454
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,165
Mr. Lord.

455
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:57,331
Mr. Lord.

456
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,540
Mr. Lord.

457
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,665
Mr. Lord.

458
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,665
Dad!

459
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:25,790
How?

460
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:28,290
How!

461
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:29,831
It's your weekend.

462
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:31,915
Yes, clearly.

463
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:34,915
Alistair.

464
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:36,206
Where's the pool, Daddy?

465
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,165
It's not done yet, buddy.

466
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,081
But it doesn't matter.

467
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,956
You just have
to be patient.

468
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,373
I told you the pool,

469
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:45,956
the helicopter,

470
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,748
you'll have it all.
But remember,

471
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,748
Rome wasn't built in a day,
was it? No.

472
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,790
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?

473
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:56,790
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

474
00:36:56,873 --> 00:37:00,123
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

475
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:03,623
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

476
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,540
Simon.

477
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,623
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

478
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:15,081
It's over, Max.

479
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,790
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

480
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,373
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

481
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,373
Simon.

482
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,790
I know it's hard
to see right now,

483
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,456
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.

484
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,373
"Turning it around"?

485
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,623
There is no oil.
There never was.

486
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,998
So how are you gonna
turn it around?

487
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:36,998
Get more
sucker investors, like me?

488
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,790
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

489
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,081
I have a big...

490
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:43,415
There's something in the works.

491
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:45,290
And it's no scheme.

492
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:49,790
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

493
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:52,206
You have oil rights on land

494
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,331
that everyone else
passed on already.

495
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:55,873
Now, it didn't take
much digging

496
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,248
to find that out.

497
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:59,373
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

498
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:01,248
Maxwell Lorenzano.

499
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:04,498
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.

500
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,956
I am not a con man!

501
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,373
I am a television personality.

502
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,873
And a respected businessman

503
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:16,373
- with a plan.
- Come on.

504
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:19,206
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

505
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,873
"If you can dream it,
you can have it."

506
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,873
Something like that?

507
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,540
You have 48 hours

508
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,706
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

509
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,915
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

510
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,081
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

511
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,581
Simon, wait.

512
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,873
I am not a loser.

513
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:52,373
He's a loser!

514
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,415
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

515
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:57,873
He's a liar...

516
00:38:57,956 --> 00:39:00,248
and he's wrong.

517
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:06,456
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

518
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:15,748
And you...

519
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:22,915
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

520
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,623
Okay.

521
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:33,206
You'll see.

522
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,415
Everyone will.

523
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,998
These are known
for a terrific fit.

524
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:27,831
Yeah, I'm just
not so great with heels.

525
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:29,456
Just try them.

526
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:33,998
Come out and show me.

527
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,873
Okay. Hmm.

528
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,206
They do fit well.

529
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,290
Ah.

530
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:48,456
Huh.

531
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:54,956
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look

532
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,581
amazing.

533
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:57,998
Do you think it's too tight?

534
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,498
I think it's just right.

535
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,456
- Wow.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:05,540
I'll take it.

537
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:26,498
Hey there. How are you doing?

538
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:56,581
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

539
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:59,331
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

540
00:41:59,415 --> 00:42:01,165
Thank you so much.

541
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:11,831
Dr. Minerva.

542
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,456
You look breathtaking.

543
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,081
Thank you.

544
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:23,873
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

545
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:26,373
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.

546
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:27,540
Mmm.

547
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:28,790
Um...

548
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:31,790
- Actually, no.
- I...

549
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:33,748
I just bought this today.

550
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,456
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

551
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,040
Took me a long time
to get ready.

552
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,248
Biotin.

553
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,581
You should try it.

554
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,123
Makes you glow like a teenager.

555
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:51,456
Reverses the clock.

556
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,581
Never accept
the limitations of nature.

557
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:55,956
Yeah, no.

558
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,373
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.

559
00:42:58,456 --> 00:42:59,623
Oh...

560
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:05,165
God, it's so loud in here.

561
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:06,540
Yeah.

562
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:09,665
Can we go somewhere?

563
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,831
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

564
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,165
Hmm... Your office?

565
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:31,998
Oh, wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...

566
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:34,290
It's so beautiful.

567
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:37,873
Like you.

568
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:45,415
What is that?

569
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,665
Um...

570
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:49,706
Uh, it's nothing special,
really.

571
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,831
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

572
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:55,373
Wow.

573
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:56,915
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

574
00:43:56,998 --> 00:43:58,831
Let me help you.

575
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:01,873
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.

576
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:04,748
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

577
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:07,498
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?

578
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:12,248
It is Latin, isn't it?

579
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,248
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

580
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,790
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.

581
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:32,998
Oh, Diana.

582
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:35,748
Hoping I'd see you.

583
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:38,040
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

584
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:42,081
Yeah, that's right. Interning,
but requested by name, so...

585
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:44,956
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

586
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,956
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.

587
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,331
Diana.

588
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,748
Diana.

589
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,456
Excuse me, I don't even know
you, so please stop following me.

590
00:45:07,498 --> 00:45:09,331
- Good night.
- But...

591
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,706
I wish we had more time.

592
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:18,331
Why did you say that?

593
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:20,998
Don't say that to me.

594
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:22,665
You don't even know me.

595
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:25,081
Yes, I do.

596
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,456
I can save today...

597
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,415
but you can save the world.

598
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,290
Steve?

599
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:57,123
Diana.

600
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:01,665
But how?

601
00:46:01,748 --> 00:46:03,956
I don't know.

602
00:46:10,165 --> 00:46:11,915
Oh, my God.

603
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:15,498
It's you.

604
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,915
I missed you.

605
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:33,748
<i>So what do you remember?</i>

606
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:37,165
I remember...

607
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:38,873
I remember taking
the plane up...

608
00:46:38,956 --> 00:46:40,248
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,206
...and then...

610
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:45,498
nothing, really.

611
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:46,998
Nothing.

612
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:49,665
But somehow, I know
I've been someplace since then.

613
00:46:49,748 --> 00:46:52,415
Someplace that's, uh...

614
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,665
I can't really put words to it.

615
00:46:56,748 --> 00:47:00,456
But it's... It's good.

616
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:08,790
And then I, uh...
I woke up here.

617
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:09,706
Where?

618
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,206
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

619
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,623
Strange, strange pillow bed
with slats.

620
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,456
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

621
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,915
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

622
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:25,706
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

623
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,915
if I'm being
really honest with you.

624
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:30,540
I mean, for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...

625
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:34,290
Eighty-four. 1984.

626
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:47,040
That's amazing.

627
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,540
Would you like
to see my futon?

628
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,873
Yeah. Um...

629
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,915
You don't have to tell me.

630
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:25,498
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.

631
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:28,331
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

632
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,748
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.

633
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:34,248
Lots of pictures of himself.

634
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:40,040
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

635
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,290
Oh, so this is
how you found me.

636
00:48:42,373 --> 00:48:44,665
Yeah, the phone book.

637
00:48:44,748 --> 00:48:47,331
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

638
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:48,665
So you went to my apartment?

639
00:48:48,748 --> 00:48:50,248
Yeah, I tried to use
the bike at first.

640
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:55,248
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

641
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:58,873
so I ran over
and saw you come back.

642
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,998
And I was stunned.

643
00:49:05,706 --> 00:49:07,165
There you were.

644
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,831
So I just, uh...

645
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,290
followed you, like a creep.

646
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:20,331
Diana, look at you. It's...

647
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:24,748
It's like not one day
has passed.

648
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,415
I can't say the same thing
about you.

649
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:32,623
Right, right, right.
Right.

650
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,623
Yeah, he's, uh...

651
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:09,706
He's got it.

652
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,498
No, I like him.

653
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:18,248
He's great,
but all I see is you.

654
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:42,540
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.

655
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:50,748
I wish to be you.

656
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,540
The Dreamstone itself.

657
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:53,581
Hi.

658
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:56,665
Come here.

659
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,498
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

660
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:04,998
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning,

661
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:07,831
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.

662
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:12,081
This place is amazing.

663
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:14,915
- This place?
- Yeah.

664
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,206
You know,
if I really think about it,

665
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,331
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.

666
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,040
- It's true.
- Yeah.

667
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:25,165
This room is
the most amazing place

668
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:26,540
I've ever been in,
in my entire life.

669
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:28,123
It's the most
amazing place, right?

670
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:31,581
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

671
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:34,081
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

672
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,165
- Okay.
- Okay.

673
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,373
Let's just stay here.

674
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:37,998
Let's just stay here.

675
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,123
Forever.

676
00:52:43,206 --> 00:52:44,373
Although...

677
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:47,206
I should probably go
and figure out

678
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:52,290
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.

679
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:58,873
That's a fair point. Let's go.

680
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:42,665
Whoa.

681
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,956
Mr. Stagg?

682
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,956
Thank you, Belinda.

683
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,873
Oh, God.

684
00:54:02,956 --> 00:54:05,081
You'd better be here
with my money.

685
00:54:05,165 --> 00:54:08,290
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

686
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,956
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

687
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,248
I'm sorry.

688
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:15,248
I messed up. I messed up.

689
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,831
I lied.

690
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:19,915
And I'm sorry.

691
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:23,165
You know, the truth is, I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.

692
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:25,331
The wells were coming up dry.

693
00:54:25,415 --> 00:54:28,998
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

694
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:30,706
I should have folded then.

695
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,956
But all the people that bought
in, that believed in me.

696
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,331
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

697
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:38,165
Max, look, you don't have to...

698
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:42,081
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

699
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:44,665
That with every ounce
of my being,

700
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:49,123
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.

701
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,498
And I know
you wished that, too.

702
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,373
Of course I wished that, too.

703
00:54:59,206 --> 00:55:01,081
Then your wish is granted.

704
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,956
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

705
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:07,915
and full control of Black Gold,

706
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:11,040
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...

707
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:13,415
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

708
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:17,706
Max!

709
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,373
Hey, Max!

710
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:24,040
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

711
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:27,331
What the hell is going on?

712
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:34,540
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.

713
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,123
My word. Are we in danger?

714
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:38,165
No, sir.
Federal taxation crime.

715
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:40,081
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.

716
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:42,331
Send them through.

717
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:44,456
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

718
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,998
Ooh.

719
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,706
So you said a stone
started all of this?

720
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,081
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

721
00:56:06,165 --> 00:56:08,665
I mean, it must have
done something.

722
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,706
This is dynamite.

723
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:12,873
What do you think?

724
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:15,248
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

725
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:18,623
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

726
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:20,498
I think we can do better.

727
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:23,123
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

728
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:24,581
There are pockets
all over the pant.

729
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,290
American issue bag, adjustable.

730
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:29,998
Parachute pants?

731
00:56:30,081 --> 00:56:32,790
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

732
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:34,456
<i>You know,
I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

733
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,998
I figure you are, but you know
what, I'm ready to go.

734
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:39,040
Mmm-mmm.

735
00:56:39,123 --> 00:56:41,540
- Right?
- No.

736
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:44,081
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

737
00:56:44,165 --> 00:56:46,831
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?

738
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:48,581
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

739
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:51,873
Now that's great.

740
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:53,831
It's beautiful.

741
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:56,456
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.

742
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,290
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

743
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,123
Who would wear this?

744
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,331
Diana,

745
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:03,873
have you seen these shoes?

746
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:06,331
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

747
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:07,665
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

748
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:19,706
This is a special one, okay?

749
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,998
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

750
00:57:23,665 --> 00:57:26,165
One foot after the other.

751
00:57:26,248 --> 00:57:28,123
Now stay on this one.

752
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:29,998
Go to the middle.

753
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:31,998
No, Steve...

754
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,040
Steve, you're gonna fall.

755
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,290
I really thought
I was gonna fall.

756
00:57:57,498 --> 00:57:59,290
What's up?

757
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:21,956
This is break dance.

758
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,706
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

759
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:30,248
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

760
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:31,540
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

761
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:32,748
It's nothing.

762
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:40,206
It's all art.

763
00:58:42,998 --> 00:58:44,081
Yeah.

764
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:50,498
Uh... That's just a trash can.

765
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,581
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:58,956
Is that a plane?

767
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,790
Come on.
I want to show you something.

768
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:24,123
This is incredible!

769
00:59:38,165 --> 00:59:40,623
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

770
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,790
<i>you strike gold.</i>

771
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:47,623
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

772
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:50,040
Raquel?

773
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:53,706
Raquel?

774
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,831
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

775
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,831
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

776
01:00:03,915 --> 01:00:05,456
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

777
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,706
The wells struck pay!

778
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,165
- Which ones?
- All of them.

779
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:10,206
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

780
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:12,706
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

781
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,873
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

782
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,665
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

783
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:19,540
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

784
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,040
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

785
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:25,790
Yes, I wish I had more help.

786
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:27,456
There are just
too many calls to take.

787
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,123
Uh... Hi.

788
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:30,665
I'm sorry to bother you.

789
01:00:30,748 --> 01:00:32,623
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

790
01:00:32,706 --> 01:00:34,040
- You're hired!
- Oh...

791
01:00:34,123 --> 01:00:35,206
Welcome aboard!

792
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,873
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

793
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:38,540
Is this the employment office?

794
01:00:38,623 --> 01:00:39,956
Yes! You're hired, too!

795
01:00:41,123 --> 01:00:43,290
Mr. Lord,
it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

796
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,665
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

797
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:50,206
I'll take it in my office.

798
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,873
And bring me my vitamins.

799
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:56,873
So I did read
about four books last night...

800
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,290
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

801
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:01,706
This is from the Song Dynasty.

802
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,873
You were correct.

803
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,706
And also interesting,

804
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,540
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...

805
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,165
Thanks. Um...

806
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:14,748
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

807
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:18,331
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

808
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:20,290
- Hi.
- Good morning.

809
01:01:20,373 --> 01:01:22,873
This is Steve. He's my, um...

810
01:01:22,956 --> 01:01:23,915
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

811
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:26,415
Hi, old friend Steve.

812
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:28,581
I'm Barbara,
Diana's new friend.

813
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:30,081
So what do you do?

814
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:31,790
I'm a pilot.

815
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:33,540
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

816
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:34,831
Sure.

817
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:41,331
So, I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.

818
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:42,790
The citrine one.

819
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:45,581
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

820
01:01:45,665 --> 01:01:49,123
Long story, actually,
about that.

821
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:52,498
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.

822
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,915
Which was actually
pretty great.

823
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:57,123
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...

824
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:59,623
I let him

825
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:01,123
borrow it.

826
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:02,415
What? Why?

827
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:03,748
Well, Diana,

828
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:05,248
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.

829
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:07,040
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

830
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,706
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert, and I don't know...

831
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,623
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?

832
01:02:10,706 --> 01:02:12,540
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

833
01:02:12,623 --> 01:02:14,706
What are you getting
on my case for?

834
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,373
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

835
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:20,206
Do you know where he took it?

836
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,706
No, I have no idea.

837
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,623
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.

838
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:25,956
Let's go.

839
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,123
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

840
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,581
Yeah. Call me.

841
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:31,956
Or not. Whatever.

842
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,290
But I'd be curious.

843
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:42,956
<i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

844
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,790
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

845
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,415
What are these people doing?

846
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:51,706
Whatever it is,

847
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,748
we're not getting in that way.

848
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:58,790
Diana. Diana, this way.

849
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:09,248
Have at it.

850
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:25,123
Strong lock.

851
01:03:39,998 --> 01:03:41,248
Steve.

852
01:03:57,498 --> 01:04:00,373
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

853
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:03,623
It's like a bomb went off.

854
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:18,165
Whatever this is,
he's been looking for it for a long time.

855
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:34,290
"Place upon
the object held."

856
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,081
What is it?

857
01:04:39,165 --> 01:04:41,790
The language of the Gods.

858
01:04:41,873 --> 01:04:44,665
Which God wrote it,
is the question.

859
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,790
Thanks.

860
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:50,456
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

861
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,665
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

862
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:55,081
- Hello?
- <i>Barbara, I need your help.</i>

863
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:57,248
<i>I need you to find out</i>

864
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:59,956
exactly where
that stone was found.

865
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,290
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

866
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:04,581
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.</i>

867
01:05:04,665 --> 01:05:06,331
Thanks.

868
01:05:08,665 --> 01:05:10,665
You look like you saw a ghost.

869
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:13,956
I did.

870
01:05:16,706 --> 01:05:19,206
There were many Gods

871
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,998
and they did different things
for different reasons.

872
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:26,165
One was making
objects like this.

873
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:28,540
There are universal elements
in this world,

874
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,623
and when they're imbued
into something,

875
01:05:31,706 --> 01:05:36,123
they can become
very, very powerful.

876
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:38,956
Like my Lasso of Truth.

877
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,331
The truth is what powers it,
not me.

878
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:44,498
The truth is bigger
than all of us.

879
01:05:44,581 --> 01:05:46,456
But what is this?

880
01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:49,706
I don't know. Uh...

881
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:53,373
Brought me back.

882
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:58,831
Love or hope...

883
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,290
maybe?

884
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:04,831
Maybe.

885
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:09,748
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

886
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,623
We need to find this guy.

887
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:13,623
Uh...

888
01:06:21,123 --> 01:06:22,915
Look at this.

889
01:06:22,998 --> 01:06:25,415
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

890
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:28,415
Cairo?

891
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:31,706
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

892
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:34,248
"King of Crude"?

893
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:36,331
How is this so fast?

894
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,790
You have a plane that can fly

895
01:06:39,873 --> 01:06:41,331
from here to Cairo in one shot?

896
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,248
That is amazing.

897
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:45,915
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

898
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:47,498
I don't want to get on one,

899
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:49,373
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

900
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:50,956
I want to fly this plane.

901
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,206
Yeah?

902
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:20,956
Oh, my Betsy.

903
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:27,956
Hey, Steve, this way.

904
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,790
Yeah.

905
01:07:29,873 --> 01:07:33,123
Look at these gams.

906
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:44,040
You wanna choose?

907
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,123
This one.

908
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,290
I like it.

909
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,748
Okay.

910
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,581
Okay. Uh...

911
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,373
No.

912
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:13,206
Uh...

913
01:08:14,331 --> 01:08:15,748
All right. Good, good.

914
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:17,873
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

915
01:08:17,956 --> 01:08:19,540
Here we go. Engine.

916
01:08:21,581 --> 01:08:22,915
Here goes nothing.

917
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:27,331
Oh...

918
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,623
- Ken?
- What?

919
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:42,373
There's an aircraft
on the runway.

920
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:43,873
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

921
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:45,248
Approach, this is Tower.

922
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:46,665
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

923
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:47,998
Are you seeing this?

924
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:53,831
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:55,415
I just have to pick up
speed first,

926
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,081
and then I'll take off.

927
01:08:57,165 --> 01:09:00,081
The way I fly,
they will never find us.

928
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,581
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

929
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:08,040
Radar. I can't explain now,

930
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:10,331
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

931
01:09:10,415 --> 01:09:13,165
Well, will they shoot at us?

932
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,456
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.

933
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:25,165
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

934
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:28,373
I know. Focus.

935
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,290
Focus.

936
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:32,498
My father hid Themyscira
from the world,

937
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,831
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

938
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:35,998
Did what?

939
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,956
Made something invisible.

940
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,206
But in 50 years,
I've only done it once.

941
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,831
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

942
01:09:41,915 --> 01:09:44,040
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

943
01:09:44,123 --> 01:09:46,665
It was just a coffee cup...

944
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:48,373
and I lost it.

945
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:14,956
Approach,

946
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,165
the aircraft has vanished.

947
01:10:16,248 --> 01:10:17,415
Do you have eyes on it?

948
01:10:45,665 --> 01:10:47,956
An invisible jet.

949
01:11:11,165 --> 01:11:12,623
What's that?

950
01:11:14,915 --> 01:11:15,873
Oh, it's okay.

951
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:17,915
It's just fireworks.

952
01:11:17,998 --> 01:11:20,665
The Fourth. Of course.

953
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:22,248
The Fourth of July?

954
01:12:02,706 --> 01:12:03,873
Wow.

955
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,040
I got an idea.

956
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:55,165
You know, it's the one thing.

957
01:12:55,248 --> 01:12:57,540
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

958
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:58,540
What?

959
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,706
Flight.

960
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,456
Your gift.

961
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,040
I'll never understand it.

962
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,331
Ah, it's...

963
01:13:07,748 --> 01:13:09,998
It's so easy, really.

964
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:13,123
It's wind and air

965
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:17,290
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

966
01:13:18,706 --> 01:13:20,331
How to join with it.

967
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:23,331
Yeah.

968
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:25,998
It's like anything, really.

969
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:52,499
Great, thanks.

970
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:55,749
Found the last one.

971
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:57,832
This should keep you busy
for a while.

972
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:02,999
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?

973
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:04,999
Tea?

974
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:07,041
Me?

975
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:11,291
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

976
01:14:11,374 --> 01:14:13,166
You're done?

977
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:16,166
Hey, you don't have
to be mean about it.

978
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,166
Hey, babe.
Where you going?

979
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:26,957
No thanks.

980
01:14:30,624 --> 01:14:32,916
Ooh, you're pretty.

981
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:35,082
Hey, slow down, sexy.

982
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:41,541
You talking to me?

983
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,666
Yep. I'm talking to you.

984
01:14:44,832 --> 01:14:48,166
Why don't you just
slow down a bit, huh?

985
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:50,166
Come on, girl.

986
01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:52,999
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?

987
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:57,707
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.

988
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,416
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.

989
01:15:01,874 --> 01:15:04,207
Like me.

990
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,582
Do you remember me?

991
01:15:07,457 --> 01:15:10,082
Oh, yeah, yeah.

992
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:13,416
I remember.
Where were we, huh?

993
01:15:16,332 --> 01:15:17,499
No.

994
01:15:21,582 --> 01:15:22,749
No.

995
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,291
No.

996
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:33,666
She's right.

997
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:36,041
It's not that hard.

998
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:44,332
Yeah, I think I get it now.

999
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,666
His body weight
does do all the work.

1000
01:15:51,832 --> 01:15:53,416
So easy.

1001
01:15:55,374 --> 01:15:56,666
I think

1002
01:15:56,749 --> 01:15:58,291
I could do this...

1003
01:16:00,832 --> 01:16:02,999
all...

1004
01:16:04,499 --> 01:16:05,707
night...

1005
01:16:07,207 --> 01:16:09,166
long!

1006
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,207
Barbara?

1007
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,541
What are you doing?

1008
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:38,291
Mind your business.

1009
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,416
Sir?

1010
01:16:54,999 --> 01:16:59,916
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

1011
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:03,582
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1012
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,332
To meet a peer.

1013
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,166
A peer?

1014
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:11,874
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.

1015
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:15,124
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1016
01:17:17,749 --> 01:17:21,624
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...

1017
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:23,999
I lucked into a secret.

1018
01:17:24,082 --> 01:17:26,249
The secret of the wish.

1019
01:17:27,082 --> 01:17:28,332
So I wished for it.

1020
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:31,832
Or someone
wished for it for me.

1021
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:35,749
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

1022
01:17:35,832 --> 01:17:38,374
and I will show you
how it works.

1023
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:42,457
I wish for things
one cannot attain.

1024
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,082
Like what?

1025
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,499
All of my land to be returned.

1026
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:50,291
My ancestral realm.

1027
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,666
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1028
01:17:52,749 --> 01:17:55,624
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1029
01:17:55,707 --> 01:18:00,916
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

1030
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:02,957
You wish for that?

1031
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:05,916
I wish for that deeply.

1032
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:13,457
Your wish is granted.

1033
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:16,749
And in return,
I will take your oil.

1034
01:18:22,874 --> 01:18:25,082
You truly delight me.

1035
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,416
You know so little.

1036
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:30,749
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1037
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,249
You are a silly man.

1038
01:18:40,832 --> 01:18:42,874
Then I will take
your security team

1039
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:44,832
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1040
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:48,582
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

1041
01:19:28,749 --> 01:19:31,749
Stop! Stop the car!

1042
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:33,124
What are you doing?

1043
01:19:33,207 --> 01:19:35,499
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1044
01:19:35,582 --> 01:19:37,457
I command you to stop!

1045
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:39,499
Stop!

1046
01:19:39,582 --> 01:19:41,832
Stop! Stop!

1047
01:19:43,832 --> 01:19:46,666
<i>This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall</i>

1048
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:48,374
<i>appears to somehow be the work</i>

1049
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:50,374
<i>of Emir Said Bin Abydos.</i>

1050
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:53,166
<i>The government is reporting

1051
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:55,499
<i>acknowledging his claim

1052
01:20:06,457 --> 01:20:07,999
You okay?

1053
01:20:08,082 --> 01:20:10,499
I'm fine.

1054
01:20:10,582 --> 01:20:14,374
You keep saying that, but...

1055
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:17,624
That was him!

1056
01:20:17,707 --> 01:20:19,791
That was Max Lord.

1057
01:20:47,832 --> 01:20:49,957
Get rid of them, please.

1058
01:21:25,707 --> 01:21:26,791
I got this.

1059
01:21:26,874 --> 01:21:27,832
What?

1060
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:30,332
Diana!

1061
01:21:44,249 --> 01:21:46,041
The brakes still work.

1062
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:02,249
Max Lord,

1063
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:05,666
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.

1064
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,624
I need you
to give me the stone.

1065
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:09,791
What happened to it?

1066
01:24:09,874 --> 01:24:11,832
You're looking at it.

1067
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:19,207
Whoa!

1068
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,707
Steve!

1069
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,249
Diana!

1070
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:15,791
So who's the next
closest person with oil?

1071
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:38,791
Diana. Diana.

1072
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:43,832
My God.
What's going on with you?

1073
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:46,582
<i>A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.</i>

1074
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:48,166
What is happening?

1075
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:49,791
<i>It's an unexplainable event</i>

1076
01:26:49,874 --> 01:26:51,749
<i>that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities</i>

1077
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:54,166
<i>entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.</i>

1078
01:26:54,249 --> 01:26:57,041
<i>An already
tense situation now escalating</i>

1079
01:26:57,124 --> 01:27:01,374
<i>as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.</i>

1080
01:27:01,457 --> 01:27:02,999
- Oh, no.
- <i>The United States,</i>

1081
01:27:03,082 --> 01:27:05,457
<i>a longtime ally of Egypt,
has declared</i>

1082
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,166
<i>their intention to side
with the government.</i>

1083
01:27:08,249 --> 01:27:10,541
<i>Bedlam on the home front
now as well</i>

1084
01:27:10,624 --> 01:27:13,124
<i>as the shocking news
that American businessman</i>

1085
01:27:13,207 --> 01:27:15,957
<i>Max Lord has somehow
come into possession</i>

1086
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:18,416
<i>of over half
of the world's oil reserves.</i>

1087
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,624
<i>The instability in the
oil community has resulted</i>

1088
01:27:21,707 --> 01:27:23,582
<i>in a nationwide run on gas,</i>

1089
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:25,624
<i>and experts are girding themselves...</i>

1090
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:26,707
Hello?

1091
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:28,124
Barbara, it's Diana.

1092
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:31,499
- Did you...
- <i>Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.</i>

1093
01:27:31,582 --> 01:27:34,124
<i>I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,</i>

1094
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,124
<i>but I've found
historical images of it.</i>

1095
01:27:37,207 --> 01:27:38,124
From where?

1096
01:27:38,207 --> 01:27:39,666
That's the weird thing.

1097
01:27:39,749 --> 01:27:41,416
From everywhere.

1098
01:27:41,499 --> 01:27:44,957
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

1099
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:47,749
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1100
01:27:47,832 --> 01:27:49,666
Kush, 4 AD.

1101
01:27:49,749 --> 01:27:51,666
Romulus, the last
Emperor of Rome,

1102
01:27:51,749 --> 01:27:54,749
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.

1103
01:27:54,832 --> 01:27:58,832
<i>The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city</i>

1104
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,332
<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

1105
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:02,166
- The Mayans.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1106
01:28:02,249 --> 01:28:04,374
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

1107
01:28:04,457 --> 01:28:08,124
and my last lead
is not that promising.

1108
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:09,374
What's that?

1109
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:11,124
<i>A flier I found.</i>

1110
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:12,999
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1111
01:28:13,082 --> 01:28:15,916
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1112
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:19,541
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1113
01:28:19,624 --> 01:28:22,374
- And he knows about the stone?
- <i>So he says.</i>

1114
01:28:22,457 --> 01:28:24,582
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.

1115
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:28,374
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1116
01:28:31,124 --> 01:28:32,999
What is it?

1117
01:28:34,832 --> 01:28:36,207
The stone has
traveled the world

1118
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,041
to seemingly random
and different places,

1119
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:40,541
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1120
01:28:40,624 --> 01:28:43,666
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1121
01:28:43,749 --> 01:28:46,041
Without a trace as to why.

1122
01:28:46,124 --> 01:28:47,916
You don't think
the stone could have...

1123
01:28:48,582 --> 01:28:49,957
Do you?

1124
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:52,249
I don't know
what to think, Steve.

1125
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:56,082
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1126
01:29:23,832 --> 01:29:26,041
Babajide?

1127
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,249
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1128
01:29:35,332 --> 01:29:36,832
Hello.

1129
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:40,457
One second.

1130
01:29:42,499 --> 01:29:44,499
So you're a Mayan?

1131
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:46,999
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.

1132
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:48,457
It says your name is Frank.

1133
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,791
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1134
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:53,124
So that's a no.

1135
01:29:53,207 --> 01:29:55,541
But to answer
your question, yes.

1136
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:58,832
My great-great-grandfather

1137
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:00,499
left me this.

1138
01:30:00,582 --> 01:30:03,666
I don't know everything about
it, but I have been warned

1139
01:30:03,749 --> 01:30:05,207
I'm better off that way.

1140
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:08,874
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

1141
01:30:08,957 --> 01:30:10,291
in a matter of months.

1142
01:30:10,374 --> 01:30:12,957
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

1143
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:16,124
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1144
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:18,957
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

1145
01:30:33,332 --> 01:30:34,749
What?

1146
01:30:35,457 --> 01:30:36,499
What is it?

1147
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:42,166
<i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

1148
01:30:42,249 --> 01:30:43,332
What's that?

1149
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,707
A very bad God.

1150
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:48,332
The God of Lies,
Dolos, Mendacius,

1151
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,666
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1152
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:53,082
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

1153
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,541
there has to be a trick.

1154
01:30:54,624 --> 01:30:56,582
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1155
01:30:56,666 --> 01:30:59,041
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.

1156
01:31:00,082 --> 01:31:02,707
Wishes with a trick.

1157
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,249
"The Monkey's Paw."

1158
01:31:05,332 --> 01:31:07,041
Beware what you wish for.

1159
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:10,457
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

1160
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,624
Diana, your powers.

1161
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:15,166
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

1162
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:17,207
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1163
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:18,499
How do we stop this?

1164
01:31:18,582 --> 01:31:20,041
The legend said

1165
01:31:20,124 --> 01:31:22,124
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1166
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:24,124
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1167
01:31:24,207 --> 01:31:25,791
and refused to do the second.

1168
01:31:26,749 --> 01:31:28,582
Now the culture's destroyed.

1169
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,541
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.

1170
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:33,582
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1171
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,457
What? When?

1172
01:31:37,624 --> 01:31:39,957
"You're looking at it."

1173
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:43,832
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.

1174
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,624
Maybe it's him.

1175
01:31:45,707 --> 01:31:47,624
He's become it somehow.

1176
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:49,582
But how would
that happen?

1177
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:52,082
I mean, if he wished for...

1178
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:03,499
No, that's crazy. No.

1179
01:32:03,582 --> 01:32:05,749
If we destroy it,

1180
01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:07,874
if we destroy him...

1181
01:32:08,874 --> 01:32:10,124
all the wishes go back.

1182
01:32:10,207 --> 01:32:11,791
What are you
talking about? No.

1183
01:32:11,874 --> 01:32:13,666
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.

1184
01:32:13,749 --> 01:32:15,582
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.

1185
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:19,082
No, there has to be
a better way.

1186
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,582
No.

1187
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,541
She's right.

1188
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:27,749
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1189
01:32:27,832 --> 01:32:30,791
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1190
01:32:30,874 --> 01:32:34,624
Stopping him might
not be enough, Diana.

1191
01:32:34,707 --> 01:32:36,291
Wishes have been made.

1192
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:39,874
Barbara?

1193
01:32:41,332 --> 01:32:42,749
Barbara?

1194
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:53,457
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.

1195
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:55,041
Can we tell them
they're not invited?

1196
01:32:55,124 --> 01:32:56,332
No, sir.

1197
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:58,249
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

1198
01:32:58,332 --> 01:33:02,124
The BBB, the FBD.

1199
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,957
It's a conspiracy
against my success.

1200
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:07,124
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1201
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,916
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

1202
01:33:09,999 --> 01:33:11,666
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1203
01:33:11,749 --> 01:33:14,832
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1204
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:16,541
And you have Alistair
for the night.

1205
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:19,832
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1206
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:20,957
What? What? When?

1207
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,457
Tonight?

1208
01:33:27,249 --> 01:33:28,416
He's here already.

1209
01:33:28,499 --> 01:33:30,249
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1210
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:37,999
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1211
01:33:38,082 --> 01:33:40,999
And buy Alistair a pony.

1212
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:43,541
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1213
01:33:45,957 --> 01:33:48,041
Let's get to it, Lai.

1214
01:33:48,124 --> 01:33:49,791
Tell me...

1215
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:52,082
what do you want?

1216
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:56,207
What do you wish for?

1217
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:58,374
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1218
01:33:58,457 --> 01:34:00,374
Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:34:00,457 --> 01:34:03,207
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.

1220
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:06,582
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves, as unrest spreads.

1221
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:09,707
And you need? What do you...

1222
01:34:09,791 --> 01:34:11,707
What do you wish for?

1223
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,999
Consider the sex tape gone.

1224
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:16,082
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

1225
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:19,124
one by one, by one, by one...

1226
01:34:19,207 --> 01:34:20,749
- How's your health?
- Well...

1227
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:21,999
Forget that.

1228
01:34:22,082 --> 01:34:24,166
But I will take
your entire congregation

1229
01:34:24,249 --> 01:34:25,624
and your time slot.

1230
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:26,707
Let me ask you,

1231
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:28,874
when they pray,
is there any way

1232
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:32,207
I could get all of them to...

1233
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,582
join hands with me?

1234
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,374
And simply say, "I wish"

1235
01:34:35,457 --> 01:34:37,457
rather than, "I pray"?

1236
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:38,916
Would that even work?

1237
01:34:38,999 --> 01:34:39,916
I don't...

1238
01:34:39,999 --> 01:34:41,332
I need to find a way

1239
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:44,249
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1240
01:34:45,499 --> 01:34:47,249
Sir. The police are here.

1241
01:34:47,332 --> 01:34:49,582
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.

1242
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:51,666
Oh, God!

1243
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:54,916
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1244
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:56,166
And my son.

1245
01:34:56,249 --> 01:34:58,249
You, beat it.

1246
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:09,541
Alistair!

1247
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:14,041
I've missed you, buddy.

1248
01:35:14,124 --> 01:35:15,999
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1249
01:35:17,666 --> 01:35:22,749
But, your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.

1250
01:35:22,832 --> 01:35:25,166
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1251
01:35:25,249 --> 01:35:27,124
Do you remember? Your dad?

1252
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:29,416
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

1253
01:35:29,499 --> 01:35:31,457
I know it's hard. I know.

1254
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:32,957
But listen,

1255
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,291
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

1256
01:35:35,374 --> 01:35:37,499
Do you hear that?
I wish for it, too.

1257
01:35:37,582 --> 01:35:38,916
I just wish
I could be with you...

1258
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:40,582
No!

1259
01:35:42,124 --> 01:35:44,832
You don't use your
one wish like that, Alistair.

1260
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:47,791
You don't wish for something
that you already have.

1261
01:35:47,874 --> 01:35:50,541
You wish for greatness,
for success.

1262
01:35:50,624 --> 01:35:52,832
That's why
I'm doing all of this.

1263
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:57,791
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1264
01:36:01,374 --> 01:36:03,249
Then I wish for your greatness.

1265
01:36:03,332 --> 01:36:05,374
No. No!

1266
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:19,749
Thank you.

1267
01:36:21,082 --> 01:36:23,166
I love you so much.

1268
01:36:23,249 --> 01:36:25,124
And I promise you, one day,

1269
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:27,666
everything is going
to make sense.

1270
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:30,666
And one day, you'll thank me.

1271
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:34,749
But right now, I, uh...

1272
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:38,166
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

1273
01:36:38,249 --> 01:36:40,499
You stay here.

1274
01:36:51,457 --> 01:36:52,874
You. You.

1275
01:36:52,957 --> 01:36:54,499
Yes, sir?

1276
01:36:54,582 --> 01:36:56,832
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1277
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:58,707
Of course I do.

1278
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:00,541
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

1279
01:37:00,624 --> 01:37:02,957
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1280
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:05,124
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1281
01:37:05,207 --> 01:37:06,707
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?

1282
01:37:07,249 --> 01:37:08,499
You!

1283
01:37:08,582 --> 01:37:09,999
Hi.

1284
01:37:10,082 --> 01:37:12,124
This way.

1285
01:37:16,916 --> 01:37:17,916
How's traffic?

1286
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,666
Huh? Terrible.

1287
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:21,374
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1288
01:37:21,457 --> 01:37:24,416
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1289
01:37:24,499 --> 01:37:28,791
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1290
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:37,999
Hey, you! Stop!

1291
01:37:38,082 --> 01:37:40,332
Come on in. It's not safe.

1292
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,416
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy

1293
01:37:42,499 --> 01:37:45,082
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1294
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:46,249
Come on. It's mad.

1295
01:37:46,332 --> 01:37:49,249
But my cows.

1296
01:37:49,332 --> 01:37:52,957
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1297
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:55,457
I didn't mean here.

1298
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,291
I'll be right back.

1299
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:02,999
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1300
01:39:03,082 --> 01:39:05,332
You don't know. You don't.

1301
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:07,291
But we...

1302
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:08,791
It can't go on like this.

1303
01:39:08,874 --> 01:39:11,041
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1304
01:39:11,124 --> 01:39:12,791
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1305
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:20,916
I give everything I have,
every day.

1306
01:39:20,999 --> 01:39:22,874
And I'm happy to.

1307
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,374
But this one thing...

1308
01:39:26,457 --> 01:39:31,124
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.

1309
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:34,874
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1310
01:39:35,707 --> 01:39:37,416
I am so sorry...

1311
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:42,166
but that's crazy.

1312
01:39:42,249 --> 01:39:46,166
There's a world
out there full of

1313
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:47,541
so many better guys, for one.

1314
01:39:47,624 --> 01:39:49,874
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

1315
01:39:49,957 --> 01:39:52,499
I don't want him. I want you.

1316
01:39:52,582 --> 01:39:55,999
Why, for once, can't I just
have this one thing, Steve?

1317
01:39:56,082 --> 01:39:57,749
This one thing.

1318
01:40:00,624 --> 01:40:03,041
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1319
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:07,707
Well, I do have a choice.

1320
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:09,291
And I can't give you up.
I can't.

1321
01:40:09,374 --> 01:40:11,749
So I won't.
So we need to stop him

1322
01:40:11,832 --> 01:40:14,041
so we can figure that out.

1323
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:15,416
There has to be another way.

1324
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:18,416
Has to.

1325
01:40:31,499 --> 01:40:32,582
Wow.

1326
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:36,541
This is incredible.

1327
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:42,624
What's that?

1328
01:40:43,999 --> 01:40:45,707
From my culture.

1329
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:50,457
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1330
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:53,207
It's huge. This whole thing?

1331
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:56,624
What is it made out of?

1332
01:40:56,707 --> 01:40:58,582
Here. Let me show you.

1333
01:40:59,374 --> 01:41:01,207
Give me your hand.

1334
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:02,916
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1335
01:41:02,999 --> 01:41:05,624
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.

1336
01:41:05,707 --> 01:41:07,832
It can make you see it, too.

1337
01:41:13,624 --> 01:41:15,332
<i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

1338
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:17,291
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

1339
01:41:17,374 --> 01:41:21,791
<i>When mankind enslaved the
Amazons, my mother freed us.</i>

1340
01:41:21,874 --> 01:41:24,916
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

1341
01:41:24,999 --> 01:41:28,166
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

1342
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,291
<i>My people gave up
all of their armor</i>

1343
01:41:30,374 --> 01:41:35,624
<i>to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.</i>

1344
01:41:35,707 --> 01:41:41,082
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

1345
01:41:44,999 --> 01:41:46,416
That's...

1346
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:49,332
That's incredible.

1347
01:41:49,416 --> 01:41:52,457
When I came here,
I searched for her.

1348
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:55,957
But all I could find
was her armor.

1349
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:57,624
What is this?

1350
01:41:58,832 --> 01:42:00,624
Where is he going?

1351
01:42:00,707 --> 01:42:02,124
Oh, no.

1352
01:42:21,832 --> 01:42:23,541
Diana, Diana!
What are you doing?

1353
01:42:23,624 --> 01:42:25,291
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1354
01:42:25,374 --> 01:42:27,374
No. No. Listen to me.

1355
01:42:27,457 --> 01:42:28,749
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1356
01:42:28,832 --> 01:42:30,082
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1357
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:33,082
You might. We don't know that.

1358
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:35,541
There has to be another way in.

1359
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:50,082
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1360
01:42:50,499 --> 01:42:51,582
Yes.

1361
01:42:52,457 --> 01:42:54,791
Something very strange. I...

1362
01:42:54,874 --> 01:42:58,499
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1363
01:42:59,832 --> 01:43:02,666
Anyway. Hectic times.

1364
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:06,207
Give us a minute.

1365
01:43:11,999 --> 01:43:12,999
Excuse me.

1366
01:43:16,457 --> 01:43:18,124
- Carl.
- Diana.

1367
01:43:18,207 --> 01:43:19,916
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1368
01:43:19,999 --> 01:43:22,124
Good to see you.
How have you been?

1369
01:43:22,207 --> 01:43:23,499
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1370
01:43:23,582 --> 01:43:25,249
Steve, this is Carl.
My colleague.

1371
01:43:25,332 --> 01:43:27,707
- Hi.
- Hi.

1372
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:29,082
Shall we, uh...

1373
01:43:29,166 --> 01:43:31,624
Yeah, we shall.

1374
01:43:31,707 --> 01:43:33,249
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1375
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,624
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1376
01:43:35,707 --> 01:43:36,957
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1377
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:40,957
These hectic days,
hectic times.

1378
01:43:42,124 --> 01:43:43,416
And you.

1379
01:43:43,499 --> 01:43:44,791
<i>These aren't
exactly my favorite</i>

1380
01:43:44,874 --> 01:43:46,582
of the busts on display here,

1381
01:43:46,666 --> 01:43:49,957
but it's a little picture of my top
ten, maybe top five at a push.

1382
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:52,249
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1383
01:43:52,332 --> 01:43:57,207
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1384
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:59,791
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.

1385
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:02,457
You're having some troubles?

1386
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,999
Everywhere suddenly.

1387
01:44:04,082 --> 01:44:05,957
Cuba, Egypt,

1388
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:07,541
even here.

1389
01:44:08,207 --> 01:44:09,707
But Russia...

1390
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:11,832
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1391
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:15,082
I appreciate your concern,

1392
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:17,374
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1393
01:44:17,499 --> 01:44:19,832
It's not money I'm offering.

1394
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:21,457
You.

1395
01:44:22,374 --> 01:44:24,332
You are a man of faith,

1396
01:44:24,416 --> 01:44:27,332
and I have been
very blessed lately.

1397
01:44:30,666 --> 01:44:33,416
I want to share
my blessing with you.

1398
01:44:34,374 --> 01:44:37,041
The power of positive thinking.

1399
01:44:40,832 --> 01:44:42,957
Now...

1400
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:46,499
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

1401
01:44:46,582 --> 01:44:50,041
And you're not speaking to me
here, but to the universe.

1402
01:44:50,124 --> 01:44:52,499
What do you wish for?

1403
01:44:54,749 --> 01:44:57,499
What is there to wish for but more?

1404
01:44:57,582 --> 01:44:59,707
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1405
01:44:59,791 --> 01:45:01,416
Closer to 'em.

1406
01:45:01,499 --> 01:45:03,374
If I just had that in place,

1407
01:45:03,457 --> 01:45:05,582
then they would
have to listen to us.

1408
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:08,874
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1409
01:45:11,707 --> 01:45:13,041
Oh... Oh, my...

1410
01:45:17,999 --> 01:45:21,332
And you know what I'd like?

1411
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:25,541
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

1412
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:26,957
All the respect you command

1413
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:31,374
and the command
everyone must respect.

1414
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:40,041
I mean, what else is there?

1415
01:45:40,124 --> 01:45:42,916
Now, tell your people
I would appreciate

1416
01:45:42,999 --> 01:45:46,749
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.

1417
01:45:46,832 --> 01:45:49,124
No taxes, no rule of law,
no limits.

1418
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:53,874
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1419
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,499
Very good, sir.

1420
01:45:56,582 --> 01:45:57,707
Right away.

1421
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:06,457
What's this?

1422
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:07,791
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1423
01:46:07,874 --> 01:46:09,416
Top-secret program
that enables us

1424
01:46:09,499 --> 01:46:11,499
to override any broadcast
system in the world

1425
01:46:11,582 --> 01:46:15,457
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1426
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:16,707
So what does that mean?

1427
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:19,082
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?

1428
01:46:19,166 --> 01:46:20,332
How?

1429
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,874
It uses
particle beam technology,

1430
01:46:21,957 --> 01:46:23,874
just like
the Star Wars program.

1431
01:46:23,957 --> 01:46:27,249
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1432
01:46:27,332 --> 01:46:30,124
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1433
01:46:30,207 --> 01:46:33,041
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.

1434
01:46:33,124 --> 01:46:34,624
Very impressive.

1435
01:46:34,707 --> 01:46:39,207
You said "touches"?

1436
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:42,374
As in the particles
you are sending...

1437
01:46:44,957 --> 01:46:49,582
are touching everything?

1438
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:51,124
It's a figure of speech,

1439
01:46:51,207 --> 01:46:52,791
but yes.

1440
01:46:52,874 --> 01:46:54,291
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1441
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:56,957
to this satellite.
And a chopper

1442
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:58,249
to get me there.

1443
01:46:58,332 --> 01:46:59,624
Yes, sir. Right away.

1444
01:47:10,249 --> 01:47:12,166
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1445
01:47:12,249 --> 01:47:15,541
Come with me before you do
any more damage, Max.

1446
01:47:15,624 --> 01:47:17,207
No. I don't think so.

1447
01:47:17,291 --> 01:47:18,957
Remove this woman, please...

1448
01:47:19,041 --> 01:47:20,916
permanently.

1449
01:47:29,749 --> 01:47:32,082
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1450
01:47:35,249 --> 01:47:36,416
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1451
01:47:36,499 --> 01:47:39,082
It's not their fault.

1452
01:48:26,707 --> 01:48:28,041
That's neat.

1453
01:49:01,374 --> 01:49:02,957
Barbara.

1454
01:49:05,999 --> 01:49:07,916
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1455
01:49:38,582 --> 01:49:41,374
Barbara. What...

1456
01:49:41,457 --> 01:49:44,457
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1457
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:47,207
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1458
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:53,124
Turns out wishing
to be like you...

1459
01:49:54,332 --> 01:49:56,416
came with some surprises.

1460
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:01,166
Hands up.

1461
01:50:01,249 --> 01:50:02,499
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.

1462
01:50:02,582 --> 01:50:03,666
Hands up!

1463
01:50:03,749 --> 01:50:05,582
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!

1464
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:20,541
Open fire!

1465
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:38,499
Oh, how sweet,
defending your love. Huh?

1466
01:50:38,582 --> 01:50:41,457
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1467
01:50:41,541 --> 01:50:42,957
No.

1468
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:45,374
Just not to be handcuffed to
you, but now I am.

1469
01:50:52,999 --> 01:50:54,791
I just learned that.

1470
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:08,291
Barbara, stop!

1471
01:51:10,791 --> 01:51:11,957
Ahh!

1472
01:51:19,582 --> 01:51:20,666
Listen.

1473
01:51:20,749 --> 01:51:21,707
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1474
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:23,082
I'm not what you think.

1475
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:24,416
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1476
01:51:24,499 --> 01:51:26,582
Oh, I can't
possibly understand?

1477
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,291
Oh...

1478
01:51:31,374 --> 01:51:32,999
Dumb little old me.

1479
01:51:33,082 --> 01:51:34,582
Dumb little, poor little

1480
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:36,624
nothing, nobody me.

1481
01:51:36,707 --> 01:51:38,249
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1482
01:51:38,332 --> 01:51:40,957
No, Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.

1483
01:51:46,874 --> 01:51:49,749
Well,
I'm handling it beautifully.

1484
01:51:49,832 --> 01:51:51,541
And I'm not giving it back!

1485
01:52:15,832 --> 01:52:16,749
Go.

1486
01:52:17,749 --> 01:52:18,791
Run!

1487
01:52:19,874 --> 01:52:21,207
Everyone, stand down.

1488
01:52:21,874 --> 01:52:24,124
Nobody hurts her.

1489
01:52:25,707 --> 01:52:27,957
They couldn't if they tried.

1490
01:52:32,374 --> 01:52:34,416
You've always
had everything,

1491
01:52:34,499 --> 01:52:37,499
while people like me
have had nothing.

1492
01:52:37,582 --> 01:52:41,999
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1493
01:52:43,582 --> 01:52:45,332
But what is it costing you?

1494
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:46,874
What is it costing me?

1495
01:52:46,957 --> 01:52:50,332
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

1496
01:52:52,374 --> 01:52:55,249
Yes, you're strong...

1497
01:52:55,332 --> 01:52:58,374
but what did you lose, Barbara?

1498
01:52:58,457 --> 01:53:01,999
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1499
01:53:02,082 --> 01:53:03,582
your humanity?

1500
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:07,541
You're attacking innocent men,
Barbara. Look at yourself.

1501
01:53:07,624 --> 01:53:09,541
Forget about me.

1502
01:53:09,624 --> 01:53:11,874
What is it costing you?

1503
01:53:16,916 --> 01:53:19,416
Yeah, yeah.

1504
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:21,416
That's right.

1505
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:24,249
Get used to it.

1506
01:53:26,874 --> 01:53:29,332
If you go after Max Lord...

1507
01:53:30,082 --> 01:53:32,416
or hurt him in any way,

1508
01:53:32,499 --> 01:53:34,041
I will destroy you.

1509
01:53:34,124 --> 01:53:35,166
Barbara!

1510
01:53:52,457 --> 01:53:54,332
Are you all right?

1511
01:54:15,707 --> 01:54:17,874
Room for one more?

1512
01:54:26,374 --> 01:54:27,666
<i>Sir, you need to wait.</i>

1513
01:54:27,749 --> 01:54:29,041
The President has
a meeting right now.

1514
01:54:29,124 --> 01:54:30,041
We need
to see the President.

1515
01:54:30,124 --> 01:54:31,666
He needs to be told.

1516
01:54:31,749 --> 01:54:33,582
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1517
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:36,582
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.

1518
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:38,624
<i>What new nukes?</i>

1519
01:54:38,707 --> 01:54:41,166
<i>A hundred warheads just went
online, ready to launch.</i>

1520
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:43,457
<i>They're taking this
as an act of war.</i>

1521
01:54:43,541 --> 01:54:45,082
Prepping to return fire.

1522
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:46,791
Return? What?

1523
01:54:46,874 --> 01:54:48,832
We haven't done anything.

1524
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,416
That's not how it looks.

1525
01:54:50,499 --> 01:54:52,916
And we'd fire for less.

1526
01:54:55,832 --> 01:54:57,499
Are you kidding me?

1527
01:54:57,582 --> 01:54:59,457
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

1528
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:00,874
How do you not see that?

1529
01:55:00,957 --> 01:55:02,791
Riots across
the world erupting

1530
01:55:02,874 --> 01:55:06,541
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,

1531
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:08,541
declaring war!

1532
01:55:08,624 --> 01:55:10,207
No one knows
any more than that.

1533
01:55:10,291 --> 01:55:12,291
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,

1534
01:55:12,374 --> 01:55:14,666
there has been
madness down here

1535
01:55:14,749 --> 01:55:16,124
in downtown Washington, D.C.

1536
01:55:16,207 --> 01:55:18,041
The national guard
has been brought in...

1537
01:55:18,124 --> 01:55:20,791
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

1538
01:55:20,874 --> 01:55:23,124
<i>By executive order,
all civilians</i>

1539
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:26,582
<i>must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor</i>

1540
01:55:26,666 --> 01:55:29,499
<i>between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.</i>

1541
01:55:37,457 --> 01:55:39,874
It is the final days
of tribulation

1542
01:55:39,957 --> 01:55:42,082
that is happening to us now.

1543
01:55:42,166 --> 01:55:45,624
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

1544
01:55:45,707 --> 01:55:47,249
Your greed?

1545
01:55:47,332 --> 01:55:50,041
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

1546
01:55:51,249 --> 01:55:54,249
Come on! This way! Come on!

1547
01:55:58,957 --> 01:56:00,666
Riley!

1548
01:56:00,749 --> 01:56:02,291
All units.

1549
01:56:02,374 --> 01:56:03,332
Riley!

1550
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:05,749
We need help.

1551
01:56:05,832 --> 01:56:08,416
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

1552
01:56:08,499 --> 01:56:12,166
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

1553
01:56:12,249 --> 01:56:14,499
Somebody help me.

1554
01:56:14,582 --> 01:56:16,874
I don't know what to do.

1555
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:22,666
Diana.

1556
01:56:23,624 --> 01:56:25,457
Diana, listen to me.

1557
01:56:30,041 --> 01:56:33,457
I had a great life.

1558
01:56:34,416 --> 01:56:35,499
Steve...

1559
01:56:35,582 --> 01:56:38,207
And you only made it better.

1560
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:43,041
But you know
what you need to do.

1561
01:56:43,124 --> 01:56:44,707
The world needs you.

1562
01:56:49,499 --> 01:56:51,666
- All right?
- No.

1563
01:56:51,749 --> 01:56:53,416
Yeah.

1564
01:57:06,249 --> 01:57:07,957
I'll never love again.

1565
01:57:08,041 --> 01:57:10,041
I pray that isn't true.

1566
01:57:10,124 --> 01:57:13,166
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.

1567
01:57:13,249 --> 01:57:16,832
This crazy new world.

1568
01:57:16,916 --> 01:57:20,124
And I am so happy
I got to see it...

1569
01:57:20,999 --> 01:57:23,207
but it deserves you.

1570
01:57:33,124 --> 01:57:35,166
I can't say goodbye.

1571
01:57:35,249 --> 01:57:38,082
I can't say goodbye.

1572
01:57:38,874 --> 01:57:40,832
You don't have to.

1573
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,499
I'm already gone.

1574
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:03,374
I'll always love you, Diana,

1575
01:58:03,457 --> 01:58:06,332
no matter where I am.

1576
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:08,166
I love you.

1577
01:58:10,874 --> 01:58:13,541
I renounce my wish.

1578
01:59:08,416 --> 01:59:09,832
<i>It's easy.</i>

1579
01:59:12,124 --> 01:59:15,041
<i>It's only wind and air...</i>

1580
01:59:16,499 --> 01:59:18,416
<i>and how to ride it.</i>

1581
01:59:20,457 --> 01:59:22,624
<i>How to catch it.</i>

1582
02:00:35,666 --> 02:00:36,999
You made a wish too, huh?

1583
02:00:41,374 --> 02:00:43,082
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1584
02:00:43,166 --> 02:00:46,749
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.

1585
02:00:46,832 --> 02:00:48,999
Luckily, I have a way
to reverse it.

1586
02:00:50,416 --> 02:00:52,874
The answer is always more.

1587
02:00:52,957 --> 02:00:54,582
But you only get one wish.

1588
02:00:54,666 --> 02:00:57,457
But I, my dear,
grant the wishes.

1589
02:00:57,541 --> 02:01:00,666
So I take
what I want in return.

1590
02:01:00,749 --> 02:01:03,666
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

1591
02:01:03,749 --> 02:01:07,374
I'll rebuild my health,
wish by wish, organ by organ...

1592
02:01:08,166 --> 02:01:09,541
if I have to.

1593
02:01:10,916 --> 02:01:12,666
I'll be invincible.

1594
02:01:14,082 --> 02:01:15,666
Tell me,

1595
02:01:15,749 --> 02:01:17,791
what do you want?

1596
02:01:17,874 --> 02:01:20,124
I'm feeling generous.

1597
02:01:23,332 --> 02:01:27,624
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.

1598
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:32,082
I want to be number one.

1599
02:01:34,749 --> 02:01:37,457
An apex predator,

1600
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:41,041
like nothing
there's ever been before.

1601
02:01:42,249 --> 02:01:44,874
I like the way you think.

1602
02:01:46,124 --> 02:01:47,582
Go on.

1603
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:04,041
You heard we were
coming, I presume?

1604
02:02:04,124 --> 02:02:07,124
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

1605
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:09,457
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1606
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:11,082
I'll take all of them.

1607
02:02:11,166 --> 02:02:12,916
All of them?

1608
02:02:12,999 --> 02:02:17,291
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?

1609
02:02:17,874 --> 02:02:19,249
Yes, sir.

1610
02:02:22,249 --> 02:02:24,416
Lights, camera...

1611
02:02:24,499 --> 02:02:26,124
Okay, stations 12,

1612
02:02:26,207 --> 02:02:28,249
9, 16, go transmit.

1613
02:02:28,332 --> 02:02:31,166
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

1614
02:02:31,249 --> 02:02:32,541
Copy. Maximum power.

1615
02:02:32,624 --> 02:02:33,874
Okay. Moving forward now.

1616
02:02:33,957 --> 02:02:35,624
Global transmission in five,

1617
02:02:35,707 --> 02:02:38,292
four, three, two...

1618
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:44,375
<i>Citizens of the world,</i>

1619
02:02:44,458 --> 02:02:48,917
<i>allow me to introduce myself.</i>

1620
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,583
<i>I am Max Lord,</i>

1621
02:02:51,667 --> 02:02:54,250
<i>and I'm here
to change your life.</i>

1622
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:57,875
<i>All you have to do...</i>

1623
02:02:58,917 --> 02:03:00,917
<i>is make a wish.</i>

1624
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:04,833
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1625
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:07,542
<i>Anything you dream of,
you can have it.</i>

1626
02:03:08,875 --> 02:03:10,625
<i>If you can dream it...</i>

1627
02:03:10,708 --> 02:03:11,667
Daddy?

1628
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:14,333
<i>...you can achieve it.</i>

1629
02:03:14,417 --> 02:03:17,292
<i>So just look into my eyes...</i>

1630
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:20,875
<i>and make a wish.</i>

1631
02:03:20,958 --> 02:03:24,292
<i>Anything you dream of,</i>

1632
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:25,500
<i>have it.</i>

1633
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,625
<i>Right now.</i>

1634
02:03:29,708 --> 02:03:32,625
<i>Do you want to be rich?</i>

1635
02:03:32,708 --> 02:03:35,792
<i>Do you want to be powerful?</i>

1636
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:37,458
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.

1637
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:38,958
- <i>Say it out loud!</i>
- You know what I wish?

1638
02:03:39,042 --> 02:03:40,500
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

1639
02:03:40,583 --> 02:03:42,958
would get sent back
to where you came from!

1640
02:03:43,042 --> 02:03:44,458
Yeah? Well, I wish
you'd drop dead!

1641
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:47,583
<i>Look around you.</i>

1642
02:03:47,667 --> 02:03:50,000
<i>Make your wish!</i>

1643
02:03:50,083 --> 02:03:51,917
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

1644
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,917
<i>Whatever you want,</i>

1645
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,583
<i>you can have it.</i>

1646
02:03:55,667 --> 02:03:57,500
I wish for a million dollars.

1647
02:04:03,042 --> 02:04:04,667
<i>Wish for it.</i>

1648
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:19,542
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1649
02:04:19,625 --> 02:04:23,917
<i>Anything you dream of, have it.</i>

1650
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:26,000
<i>Yes.</i>

1651
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:27,542
<i>I can hear it.</i>

1652
02:04:27,625 --> 02:04:30,375
<i>I hear you.</i>

1653
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:31,542
<i>Yes, say it.</i>

1654
02:04:31,625 --> 02:04:33,375
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

1655
02:04:33,458 --> 02:04:35,250
That's right.
"I wish."

1656
02:04:36,792 --> 02:04:37,750
Take it.

1657
02:04:37,833 --> 02:04:40,125
Take it. It's all yours.

1658
02:04:40,208 --> 02:04:42,042
It's all yours for the taking!

1659
02:04:46,625 --> 02:04:49,583
And I... I take your health

1660
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:52,458
and your strength.

1661
02:04:52,542 --> 02:04:54,125
Give her your rage

1662
02:04:54,208 --> 02:04:56,125
and your prowess.

1663
02:04:56,208 --> 02:04:59,125
And I take your power.

1664
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:01,333
I take your life force.

1665
02:05:01,417 --> 02:05:03,250
Yes.

1666
02:05:03,333 --> 02:05:04,833
Yes!

1667
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:08,958
That's right.

1668
02:05:09,042 --> 02:05:11,750
You're doing great.

1669
02:05:17,875 --> 02:05:19,625
<i>It's all yours.</i>

1670
02:05:19,708 --> 02:05:21,167
I wish you were here, Daddy.

1671
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:23,125
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy, please!

1672
02:05:23,208 --> 02:05:26,292
- <i>All you have to do is wish for it.</i>
- I'm still here, Daddy.

1673
02:05:26,375 --> 02:05:28,208
Daddy, please!

1674
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:43,750
Barbara.

1675
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,875
What did you do?

1676
02:08:34,375 --> 02:08:35,375
No.

1677
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:38,958
You renounced your wish.

1678
02:08:39,042 --> 02:08:41,958
I had to. And so do you.

1679
02:08:42,042 --> 02:08:45,625
Nothing good is born
from lies, Barbara.

1680
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:48,458
We're wasting precious time.

1681
02:08:48,542 --> 02:08:52,792
Even now, patronizing me.

1682
02:10:22,458 --> 02:10:24,208
Barbara...

1683
02:10:24,292 --> 02:10:26,083
I know you're in there. Please.

1684
02:10:26,167 --> 02:10:27,917
Please, renounce your wish.

1685
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,333
It's over.

1686
02:10:29,417 --> 02:10:31,375
Please!

1687
02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:33,208
Renounce your wish.

1688
02:10:33,292 --> 02:10:34,542
Never!

1689
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:39,667
Then I'm so sorry.

1690
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,000
That's right.

1691
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:25,792
Just wish for it.

1692
02:11:25,875 --> 02:11:27,333
It's yours now.

1693
02:11:28,542 --> 02:11:31,083
All you have to do is
say it out loud.

1694
02:11:31,167 --> 02:11:33,708
Make a wish. Any wish.

1695
02:11:33,792 --> 02:11:37,042
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,

1696
02:11:37,125 --> 02:11:38,708
it's all yours.

1697
02:11:38,792 --> 02:11:39,750
You're too late.

1698
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,333
Granted.

1699
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:45,708
Granted.

1700
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:48,292
Granted.

1701
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:50,917
Granted!

1702
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,667
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

1703
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:55,458
Don't you have enough?

1704
02:11:55,542 --> 02:11:57,375
Why not more?

1705
02:11:57,458 --> 02:11:59,125
Why not wish for more?

1706
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,625
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

1707
02:12:01,708 --> 02:12:03,792
We want what we want.

1708
02:12:03,875 --> 02:12:05,583
Just like you did.

1709
02:12:07,667 --> 02:12:09,167
So make a wish.

1710
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:10,333
Very good.

1711
02:12:20,458 --> 02:12:22,500
Granted.

1712
02:12:24,458 --> 02:12:27,083
It's too late, Diana.

1713
02:12:27,167 --> 02:12:29,750
They already heard me.

1714
02:12:29,833 --> 02:12:32,208
Already wished!

1715
02:12:34,083 --> 02:12:38,167
And those that haven't yet...

1716
02:12:40,292 --> 02:12:43,417
oh, they will!

1717
02:12:56,625 --> 02:12:58,667
Granted.

1718
02:12:58,750 --> 02:13:00,792
Granted.

1719
02:13:01,833 --> 02:13:03,292
Granted.

1720
02:13:09,042 --> 02:13:11,333
Poor Diana.

1721
02:13:12,292 --> 02:13:14,625
Why be such a hero?

1722
02:13:15,833 --> 02:13:18,542
You could have kept your pilot

1723
02:13:18,625 --> 02:13:20,250
and your powers,

1724
02:13:20,333 --> 02:13:23,542
if only you'd join me.

1725
02:13:23,625 --> 02:13:26,875
Wanna reconsider?

1726
02:13:27,875 --> 02:13:31,083
I'm a forgiving man!

1727
02:13:35,042 --> 02:13:37,125
You want him back?

1728
02:13:37,208 --> 02:13:39,667
Just say the word.

1729
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,333
You can have it all!

1730
02:13:42,417 --> 02:13:46,625
You just have to want it!

1731
02:13:48,667 --> 02:13:51,958
I've never wanted
anything more.

1732
02:13:57,833 --> 02:14:00,792
But he's gone...

1733
02:14:00,875 --> 02:14:03,917
and that's the truth.

1734
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,292
And everything has a price.

1735
02:14:06,375 --> 02:14:08,875
One I'm not willing to pay.

1736
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:10,542
Not anymore.

1737
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:22,458
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...

1738
02:14:23,542 --> 02:14:26,917
and you cannot have it all.

1739
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,583
You can only have the truth.

1740
02:14:30,667 --> 02:14:33,625
And the truth is enough.

1741
02:14:33,708 --> 02:14:36,042
The truth is beautiful.

1742
02:14:39,042 --> 02:14:41,208
So look at this world...

1743
02:14:42,542 --> 02:14:47,000
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

1744
02:14:47,083 --> 02:14:50,958
You must be the hero.

1745
02:14:51,042 --> 02:14:54,583
Only you can save the day.

1746
02:14:56,125 --> 02:14:59,000
Renounce your wish

1747
02:14:59,083 --> 02:15:01,208
if you want to save this world.

1748
02:15:01,292 --> 02:15:03,667
Why would I...

1749
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:07,500
when it's finally my turn?

1750
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,542
The world belongs to me!

1751
02:15:12,625 --> 02:15:16,625
You can't stop me. No one can!

1752
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,083
I wasn't talking to you.

1753
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:31,208
I was talking to everyone else.

1754
02:15:35,375 --> 02:15:38,667
<i>Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.</i>

1755
02:15:40,125 --> 02:15:41,500
<i>Who wants more.</i>

1756
02:15:45,458 --> 02:15:48,625
<i>Who wants them back.</i>

1757
02:15:50,292 --> 02:15:53,417
<i>Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.</i>

1758
02:15:56,875 --> 02:15:58,875
<i>Or alone.</i>

1759
02:15:58,958 --> 02:16:00,375
<i>Stop!</i>

1760
02:16:00,458 --> 02:16:02,750
Cut the signal! Stop!

1761
02:16:02,833 --> 02:16:04,875
Or frightened.

1762
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:07,542
Or powerless.

1763
02:16:07,625 --> 02:16:11,292
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

1764
02:16:11,375 --> 02:16:14,708
where everything was different.

1765
02:16:19,208 --> 02:16:20,500
<i>Better.</i>

1766
02:16:20,583 --> 02:16:23,167
<i>Finally.</i>

1767
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:30,750
<i>A world where they were loved</i>

1768
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:34,083
<i>and seen, and appreciated.</i>

1769
02:16:34,708 --> 02:16:35,667
Finally.

1770
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:37,750
<i>Oh, my God. Who is he?</i>

1771
02:16:37,833 --> 02:16:40,083
He doesn't even speak English.

1772
02:16:40,167 --> 02:16:41,917
What is he eating?

1773
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,083
Look at his shoes!

1774
02:16:44,458 --> 02:16:45,500
Weirdo!

1775
02:17:05,083 --> 02:17:08,958
<i>But what is it costing you?</i>

1776
02:17:09,042 --> 02:17:11,542
Do you see the truth?

1777
02:17:23,667 --> 02:17:24,667
<i>Daddy!</i>

1778
02:17:26,375 --> 02:17:28,292
<i>Daddy!</i>

1779
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:42,042
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

1780
02:17:42,125 --> 02:17:43,958
All right, all right.

1781
02:18:01,542 --> 02:18:03,458
Alistair!

1782
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:06,208
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

1783
02:18:06,292 --> 02:18:08,542
<i>You have four minutes
to find shelter.</i>

1784
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:15,667
Alistair!

1785
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:17,917
My son!

1786
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,875
<i>Stay calm
and stay indoors.</i>

1787
02:18:20,958 --> 02:18:22,667
Alistair!

1788
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:25,667
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

1789
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:26,792
Help me, Daddy!

1790
02:18:26,875 --> 02:18:28,500
<i>This is not a test.</i>

1791
02:18:28,583 --> 02:18:29,667
Daddy!

1792
02:18:32,292 --> 02:18:33,708
<i>Daddy!</i>

1793
02:18:33,792 --> 02:18:35,583
<i>One-minute warning.</i>

1794
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,583
Wait. My son!

1795
02:18:38,667 --> 02:18:40,500
I can see my son!

1796
02:18:40,583 --> 02:18:42,417
Save him, Max.

1797
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:45,625
I have to save my son.

1798
02:18:45,708 --> 02:18:47,292
<i>Daddy!</i>

1799
02:18:47,375 --> 02:18:48,542
Alistair.

1800
02:18:48,625 --> 02:18:50,875
Daddy!

1801
02:18:50,958 --> 02:18:52,042
Daddy!

1802
02:18:52,708 --> 02:18:55,500
My... Alistair.

1803
02:18:56,792 --> 02:18:59,167
I renounce my wish!

1804
02:19:13,833 --> 02:19:15,542
I renounce my wish.

1805
02:19:18,833 --> 02:19:21,458
We have missiles
disappearing, sir.

1806
02:19:22,458 --> 02:19:23,708
Yes, sir.

1807
02:19:23,792 --> 02:19:26,042
<i>They are vanishing
from our screen.</i>

1808
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,917
<i>Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire</i>

1809
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,375
<i>between the Soviet Union
and the United States</i>

1810
02:19:34,458 --> 02:19:37,083
<i>has averted
a global nuclear crisis.</i>

1811
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:40,750
I renounce my wish.

1812
02:19:58,917 --> 02:20:00,292
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

1813
02:20:22,583 --> 02:20:24,875
Alistair!

1814
02:20:31,417 --> 02:20:33,333
Alistair!

1815
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:36,375
Alistair!

1816
02:20:38,833 --> 02:20:39,833
Daddy!

1817
02:20:46,333 --> 02:20:48,250
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

1818
02:20:52,375 --> 02:20:54,125
Alistair.

1819
02:20:57,292 --> 02:20:59,333
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.

1820
02:20:59,417 --> 02:21:01,833
I'm so sorry, baby.

1821
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:07,958
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

1822
02:21:10,917 --> 02:21:12,000
No.

1823
02:21:13,083 --> 02:21:15,125
That is not why I'm back.

1824
02:21:15,792 --> 02:21:16,875
No.

1825
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:20,958
I've been lying to you.

1826
02:21:22,375 --> 02:21:25,500
I'm not a great guy.

1827
02:21:25,583 --> 02:21:28,417
In fact, I'm a pretty
messed up, loser guy.

1828
02:21:30,417 --> 02:21:33,208
And I made terrible mistakes.

1829
02:21:34,042 --> 02:21:35,792
But you...

1830
02:21:37,667 --> 02:21:41,458
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.

1831
02:21:42,917 --> 02:21:45,458
I'm here because I love you.

1832
02:21:47,792 --> 02:21:49,750
I just...

1833
02:21:49,833 --> 02:21:52,000
I just wish and I pray that,
one day,

1834
02:21:52,083 --> 02:21:53,667
I'll be able to
make you proud enough

1835
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,458
that you'll be
able to forgive me.

1836
02:21:57,917 --> 02:21:59,750
And love me.

1837
02:21:59,833 --> 02:22:02,792
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

1838
02:22:02,875 --> 02:22:05,917
I don't need you
to make me proud.

1839
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,458
I already love you, Daddy.

1840
02:22:08,542 --> 02:22:10,750
You're my dad.

1841
02:22:57,708 --> 02:23:00,458
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

1842
02:23:00,542 --> 02:23:03,000
It's okay. It's okay.

1843
02:23:08,042 --> 02:23:10,292
So beautiful.

1844
02:23:15,375 --> 02:23:19,958
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

1845
02:23:22,208 --> 02:23:24,083
It's all right.

1846
02:23:24,167 --> 02:23:25,875
It's just that...

1847
02:23:25,958 --> 02:23:30,958
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.

1848
02:23:31,917 --> 02:23:33,458
Yeah.

1849
02:23:34,458 --> 02:23:36,500
I know what you mean.

1850
02:23:41,875 --> 02:23:43,833
I like your...

1851
02:23:43,917 --> 02:23:45,125
I like your outfit.

1852
02:23:45,667 --> 02:23:47,333
You like...

1853
02:23:47,417 --> 02:23:48,417
Thanks.

1854
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:50,375
You know, my friends...

1855
02:23:50,458 --> 02:23:53,833
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

1856
02:23:53,917 --> 02:23:55,792
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1857
02:23:55,875 --> 02:23:58,333
You just made my day.

1858
02:24:06,042 --> 02:24:09,042
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

1859
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,208
So many things.

1860
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:58,250
So, so many things.

1861
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:36,167
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1862
02:26:38,917 --> 02:26:40,417
Oh, my God.

1863
02:26:42,125 --> 02:26:44,042
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

1864
02:26:44,125 --> 02:26:45,708
Um, excuse me.

1865
02:26:45,792 --> 02:26:48,958
Excuse me. Please,
you have to let me thank you, Miss...

1866
02:26:50,292 --> 02:26:51,417
Asteria.

1867
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:54,250
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.

1868
02:26:54,333 --> 02:26:55,792
It's from my culture.

1869
02:26:55,875 --> 02:26:58,250
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

1870
02:26:58,333 --> 02:27:00,083
How did you do that?

1871
02:27:00,167 --> 02:27:04,167
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

1872
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:07,667
But I've been
doing this a long time.

1873
